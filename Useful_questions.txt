1. Given an array of int, print each number against how much time they occur in the array
 example: [4,6,5,3,2,7,6,5] 
 Answer : 4-> 1, 6->2, 5->2, 3->1, 2->1, 7->1
 
2. A string for example : AAAAABBBCCCCDD has to be converted into A5B3C4D2

3. Find next permutation of the string.

4. Given list of strings find the string which occur the most.

5. Given a list of numbers find the pairs with sum K.

6. Given a list of numbers, move all non zero numbers to right and all zeros to left.

7. Find kth smallest number in a BST.

8. Find and remove the given character from a text file.

9. Find whether a given number is a exact power of 2 or not.

10. Construct BST from sorted array

11. Design a stack that supports additional operation Min() which should return minimum element from the Stack.

12. Find the number of islands in MxN matrix. A group of connected 1s forms an island.

13. Return a random value from array with probability proportional to its value.

14. Given a string find the complement of the string and then change each character of the string based on some condition.

  eg:  You have been give a string "HELLO", find complement of it so it will be "OLLEH" the condition will be such that replace "O" with "H" and "L" with "O" and print the output.

15. Given an array of String find the first repeating String.

16. Given an array of numbers modify the array element in such a way that not a single element should be duplicate of each other and then sum up all the element of array and you have to modify in such a way that sum of the element should be possible minimum.

17. Check whether the given linkedlist is a palindrome or not

18. Given a string, make a palindrome out of it. If Many palindroms can be formed, return any one.

19. Given a perfect square, find the square root of it.

20. Find nth node from the end of a linked list.

21. Given a list of unbalanced parantheses, make it balanced. But you can only append or prepend parantheses, no other manipulation is allowed.

22. Check for Balanced parentheses in an expression.

23. Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

24. Find the maximum triplet product in an array.

25. Given an array, replace the duplicate elements by incrementing them until all the array elements are unique. Calculate the minimum sum of the array after this.

26. Given a word, we have to find that the given word is an anagram or not

27. Spiral matrix
  [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
  ]

  Expected output : [1,2,3,4,8,12,16,15,14,13,9,5,6,7,11,10]
