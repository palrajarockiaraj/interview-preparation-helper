13. Return a random value from array with probability proportional to its value.

14. Given a string find the complement of the string and then change each character of the string based on some condition.

  eg:  You have been give a string "HELLO", find complement of it so it will be "OLLEH" the condition will be such that replace "O" with "H" and "L" with "O" and print the output.

15. Given an array of String find the first repeating String.

16. Given an array of numbers modify the array element in such a way that not a single element should be duplicate of each other and then sum up all the element of array and you have to modify in such a way that sum of the element should be possible minimum.

17. Check whether the given linkedlist is a palindrome or not

18. Given a string, make a palindrome out of it. If Many palindroms can be formed, return any one.

19. Given a perfect square, find the square root of it.

20. Find nth node from the end of a linked list.

21. Given a list of unbalanced parantheses, make it balanced. But you can only append or prepend parantheses, no other manipulation is allowed.

22. Check for Balanced parentheses in an expression.

23. Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

24. Find the maximum triplet product in an array.

25. Given an array, replace the duplicate elements by incrementing them until all the array elements are unique. Calculate the minimum sum of the array after this.

26. Given a word, we have to find that the given word is an anagram or not

27. Spiral matrix
  [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
  ]

  Expected output : [1,2,3,4,8,12,16,15,14,13,9,5,6,7,11,10]

28. FizzBuzz
  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

29. Find the fibonacci series for the given number.
    Example: 1 1 2 3 5 8 ...

30. String Reversal
  Example: abcd => dcba, apple => elppa

31. Sort an array and remove duplicates

32. Code a function that returns true if a given string was a valid email address, false otherwise

33. Factorial string

34. Write and execute a program to find second largest digit in a integer array
